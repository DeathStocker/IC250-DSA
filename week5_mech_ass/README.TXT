When running the file for the first time,
There will be an error in the output from GNUPlot.
This error is because the data file has just one point
and we are trying to plot "with line".

When the different values of N are entered,
that is N = 11, 51, 101, 501, 1001,

This error will disappear after the 2nd run of different N.
